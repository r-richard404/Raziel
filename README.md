# Raziel
Cryptographic Android application written in Java with the scope of giving the user the responsibility to secure it's own private files on the user's device
Uses wide variety of mobile encryption algorithms such as AES-256, ChaCha20, Twofish, ...
Using only the android's phone capabilites in terms of hardware and software, nothing extra required and everything is kept local

Using the novelty of analysing the blinking patter of the user to add entropy to the key used for encryption

Future Work:
- Programming compassion, love and empathy into a bot to have a unique connection with the sole user which will be used as complexity for the key
- Adding multiple users needing strong trusting connection in order to access certain encrypted data
- Reward based system
